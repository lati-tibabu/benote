- `components.md`: Component structure and patterns
- `state-management.md`: Redux store configuration and slices
- `routing.md`: Application routing structure
- `authentication.md`: Authentication flow and implementation
- `api-integration.md`: API communication patterns
- `styling.md`: Styling approach with Tailwind CSS
- `deployment.md`: Build and deployment process
- `testing.md`: Testing strategies and setup
- `hooks.md`: Custom React hooks
- `utils.md`: Utility functions and helpers

## API Documentation

The `API/` subdirectory contains comprehensive documentation for backend API endpoints and frontend integration details:

- `endpoints.md`: Complete REST API reference with request/response examples
